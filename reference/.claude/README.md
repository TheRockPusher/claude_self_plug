# `.claude` Workspace

This directory is reserved for Claude-specific project assets. A few ideas for
how you might use it:

- Store reusable prompt templates in `commands/`
- Capture automation workflows or scripts
- Keep reference documentation for collaborators interacting with Claude

Feel free to expand or reorganise this folder to suit your team's workflow.
